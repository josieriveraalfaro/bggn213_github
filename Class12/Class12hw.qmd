## Population Scale Analysis

q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
expr<-read.table("sample_gen0_exp.csv")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```
```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(expr)+ aes(geno, exp, fill=geno)+
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```
G/G in this location is associated the lower  expression levels of ORMDL3.
